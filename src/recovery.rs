//! Helper to recover the amount from a list of `GroupElement` pedersen commitments

use std::collections::HashMap;

use crate::{
    generators::GENERATORS,
    secp::{GroupElement, Scalar},
};

/// Recover the amounts encoded in a list of Pedersen commitments using the Baby-step giant-step algorithm.
///
/// This function takes a list of `GroupElement` commitments and their corresponding blinding factors,
/// and attempts to recover the original amounts that were committed. The recovery process is based on
/// the Baby-step giant-step algorithm, which is an efficient method for solving the discrete logarithm
/// problem in a group. The algorithm works by precomputing a table of values to speed up the search
/// for the original amounts.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `commitments` - A slice of `GroupElement` representing the Pedersen commitments from which the
///   amounts are to be recovered.
/// * `blinding_factors` - A slice of `Scalar` representing the blinding factors corresponding to each
///   commitment. These factors are used to unblind the commitments to retrieve the original amounts.
/// * `hypothesized_max_amount` - A `u64` value that serves as an upper bound for the amounts. This value
///   is used to determine the size of the precomputed table and limits the range of possible amounts
///   that can be recovered.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `Vec<Option<u64>>` where each element corresponds to the recovered amount for each commitment. If
/// an amount could not be recovered, the corresponding entry will be `None`. Otherwise, it will contain
/// the recovered amount as a `u64`.
///
/// # References

/// [Wikipedia: Baby-step giant-step algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby-step_giant-step)
